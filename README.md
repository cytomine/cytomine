# Cytomine Platform

Cytomine is an open-source platform for collaborative analysis of large-scale imaging data.

This repository provides the necessary files and instructions to build and launch the Cytomine product using Docker Compose.

## Installation

### Installation

> By default, the docker compose is configured to pull images directly from DockerHub.

docker compose up -d
```

Once all services are running, the application will be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1).

### Stop and delete the data from Cytomine

To stop Cytomine and remove its volumes, run:

```sh
docker compose down -v
```

To delete the data and databases, run:

```sh
sudo rm -rf ./data
```

## How to use the Cytomine dev environment

To start a development environment for specific Cytomine services, use the `start-dev` command in the Makefile:

```bash
make dev <service-a> <service-b> ...
```

Where the available services are

| Profile | Description                |
|---------|----------------------------|
| `ae`    | App Engine                 |

> ðŸ’¡ There must be at least one service in dev mode.

### Examples

Start the App Engine and UI services in development mode:
