# Introduction

In this section, we will explore the various features of this new ergonomic version of Cytomine, the solution for your projects in research, education or diagnostics.

## Where to start

If you don't know Cytomine yet, follow first the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) page to have a guided tour.

## Cytomine concepts

The different Cytomine concepts and their features are deeply described in this guide.

The **[Roles](./role.md)** of the users define their platform and project related permissions.

A **[Project](./project.md)** is a secure working space to share images with other selected users.

The **[Storage and Upload](./storage.md)** page will explain how to upload and manage your uploaded files into Cytomine.

The **[Image viewer](./image-viewer.md)** will allow you to browse gigapixel images and compare them in a collaborative way within a project.

Images can be multidimensional (2D+C+Z+T) and multispectral (such as in hyperspectral imagery, imaging mass spectrometry,...) using OME-Zarr (under development, to be documented).

With the concept of **[Annotations](./annotations.md)**, we will be able to draw, save _Regions Of Interest_ inside the images of a project and associate semantic values to them.

Images and annotations can be grouped into **[Image Groups](./image-group.md)** and **[Annotation Links](annotation-link.md)**, respectively, to handle multimodal datasets where a sample is described by multiple images.

The **[Administrator Panel](./administration.md)** allows the administrator of a Cytomine instance to modify some global configurations and to have some global metrics.
