Cytomine is being deployed at {{ .Values.global.domainName }}.

Admin credentials are:
    username: admin
    password: {{ $secret }}

It takes a few minutes for it to fully deploy, so please be patient. This usually takes about 5 minutes, and if the site isn't reachable in 10 minutes,
something has likely gone wrong.
