title: Cytomine Task

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

::: warning
App Engine and its Task system are still in BETA. Therefore, all information presented in this documentation is subject to potentially breaking changes.
:::

A Task is a time-limited process that takes static inputs and produces static outputs represented by files and directories. A Task is defined by:

1. a _docker image_ encapsulating the environment and procudure of the Task
2. a _descriptor file_ providing both general and technical information about the Task itself

In order to upload a Task on Cytomine, it must be bundled as a `zip` archive containing the docker image and the descriptor file. The Docker image must be [saved into a `tar` archive](/dev-guide/algorithms/task/task-docker-image) before being included in the bundle.

## How to create a Task

1. Write your Task descriptor based on the [Task descriptor reference](/dev-guide/algorithms/task/descriptor-reference)
1. Implement your Task in such a way that the script or program running the Task can be containerised
1. Create a Dockerfile to build the [Task container image](/dev-guide/algorithms/task/task-docker-image)
1. [Build and save the Docker image](/dev-guide/algorithms/task/task-docker-image#how-to-bundle-the-task-image) as a `tar` archive, the name of the archive should be formatted following `{namespace}-{version}.tar` and matching `configuration.image.file` in descriptor 
1. Bundle the saved Docker image and the Task descriptor into a `zip` archive

## Run

To run a task in the app-engine it creates a context for the execution to manage inputs provisioning, outputs generation, the `Run` has different states tracking the flow of execution.

| STATE        |       DESCRIPTION                                                                    |
| -------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CREATED      |      Created but not all inputs provisioned                                          |
| PROVISIONED  |      Ready to be executed, all inputs have been provisioned                          |
| QUEUING      |      Submitting the task to the execution environment                                |
| QUEUED       |      Evaluated successfully by execution environment                                 |
| RUNNING      |      Task running in the execution environment                                       |
| FAILED       |      An error occurred and stopped the process of executing the task (terminal state)|
| PENDING      |      Pending execution on the execution environment                                  |
| FINISHED     |      Task successfully executed and outputs available (terminal state)               |

## Storage

The app-engine controls provisioning of inputs to tasks and outputs back to consumers like `core` in Cytomine, every `Run` has its separate storage 
that contains the provisioned inputs and the generated outputs, and tasks metadata files like descriptors or logos. Data is represented in storage following the definitions of parameter data types as defined in [Task I/O](/dev-guide/algorithms/task/task-io)

The task run directories can be accessed by tasks running in [local mode](/dev-guide/algorithms/task/execution#local-mode) mode by mounting them as volumes.
