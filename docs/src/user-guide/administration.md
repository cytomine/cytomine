# Administration

In all Cytomine instances, there are specific users with extended permissions that are able to manage their Cytomine instance.

## Prerequisite

You must have an ADMIN account (see the [Users role](./role.html) section for details about users roles) and have activated your administrator section using the _Open admin session_ option in the account drop-down menu in the top right corner.

## How to go to the admin panel

First, we need to activate the "admin mode" by clicking on the button _Open Admin Session_.  
You have now a red "Admin" label next to your username and an "Admin" button is now available at the top navigation bar.

## Dashboard

The first screen of the administrator section is the dashboard of the whole Cytomine platform containing information about online users, the active project, the used storage space and the number of all the images, projects, annotations, etc. through the platform and graphs displaying the last connections.

For each user, you can edit its information, lock the user (it will not be able to connect on Cytomine unless you unlock it) and display some details.
In the details, you can be connected as the selected user on Cytomine, see its projects, annotations and so on.

## Tags

This panel contains all the tags defined in your Cytomine instance.

## Configuration

This panel contains all the global configurations of the instance. Currently, only the welcome message is editable.
