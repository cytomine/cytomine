# Image Group

As previously explained on the [Project page](./project.md), the project consists of a raw (one-level) list of images with no links or relationships between them, as shown below:

In some studies, it may be necessary to link images that are related, such as images from a sample acquired using different preparation methods (e.g., IHC staining) or acquisition protocols (e.g., different scanners or microscopes).

The **ImageGroup** concept represents a collection of related images. This concept therefore allows to link multiple, multimodal images. With image groups, annotations can also be linked accross images, such as associating a region of interest in Image A with corresponding regions in Images B, C, and so on.

## Create an Image Group

To create an image group, go to the “_Image groups_” panel and click on ”_Add image group_”. Then, choose a name for your new Image Group:

![Create an Image Group](/images/user-guide/image-group/create-new-image-group-name.png)

You will then be able to select images from your project and associate them to this image group:

![Add images to an Image Group](/images/user-guide/image-group/add-images-to-image-group.png)

You will then have a list of image groups in your project (in this case, 4 different image groups, each containing a varying number of images). In this example, the last image group contains 10 images:

When using the multiple image viewer, you can also browse from one image to another in this ImageGroup using "Previous image in group" or "Next image in group":
