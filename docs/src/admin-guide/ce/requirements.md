# Requirements for Cytomine Community Edition

## Hardware

Cytomine is a set of multithreaded tools. A minimum of **8 CPU cores** is required. The number of required cores is proportional to the expected activity. The more you want to support active users, the more you need cores. For a server-setup configuration, we recommend to use at least 16 cores.

Regarding memory, a minimum of **8 GB** is required, but we recommend at least **16 GB**.

Cytomine installation requires about **15GB**. You need to provide enough space to store your images (depends on their size). If database backup is enabled, extra-space has to be provided.

## Software

Cytomine can only be installed on any **Linux** operating system that supports recent versions of **Docker** and **bash**.

**Docker must be installed** : See [Official Docker Engine installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
