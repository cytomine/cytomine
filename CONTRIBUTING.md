# Cytomine Contributing Guide

Hey there!
Thanks for helping to make Cytomine even better. Whether you are fixing a bug, improving docs, or adding a new feature, your help means a lot!

This guide will walk you through how to set up your environment, follow our coding style, and submit your contributions smoothly.

Please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](https://doc.uliege.cytomine.org/community/code-of-conduct) before diving into the guidelines.

## Understand the basics

If you are new to *pull requests* (often called "PR") or unsure how to submit one, take a moment to read GitHub's [Using Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) guide.

If you are not familiar with forks, take a moment to read GitHub's [Fork a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) guide.
